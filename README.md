# EE305_Project_Greenhouse
Master code for running greenhouse
## Summary
The purpose of this project is to utilize electronics and sensors to automate several greenhouse functions on a model scale as both a prototype for a full-size microcontroller-based automation system and as an educational model that can be used to demonstrate how an automated greenhouse works. Our team developed sensors for relative humidity, temperature, and light level in order to direct automated heating, cooling, and lighting systems, as well as an automated irrigation system running on a timer. The main goals of the project were to create code that used sensor data to activate several of the systems both for demonstration purposes and actual utilizing of the greenhouse; to assemble a suitable greenhouse setup from a clear tub; and to organize the system in a way that would provide accurate data on greenhouse conditions. Each component was tested separately and as a whole, and the automated greenhouse was able to function as outlined in the project backlog.
